<h3>Template Files</h3>
<p>The HTML for booking box widgets are provided as a file in the theme-files directory.</p>
<p>These files can be edited to create your own cusomised booking widgets.</p>
<p>The files can be moved to and distributed in your theme directory. This will avoid over-writing if you update the plugin. If the file exists in the theme directory it is used, if it does not exist in the theme directory the file in the plugin directory is used.</p>
<p>The files contain translation variables which contain content for the selected language.</p>
<p>Individual files for specific languages can also be created. The files must be named with the 2 letter language code as per the following example for French beds24-box-fr.php. If a matching language specific file is found it will be used, otherwise the standard file will be used.</p>
